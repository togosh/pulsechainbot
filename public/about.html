        <h1>How This Chatbot Works (Transparency Report)</h1>
        <p>This page details exactly how the PulseChainBot works, including its core technology, the instructions it follows, and the data it uses. Transparency is key to building trust.</p>

            <h2>The Technology: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)</h2>
            <p>This isn't just a generic AI. It uses a system called **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**. Hereâ€™s a simple breakdown:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>You Ask a Question:</strong> You type a question like "How do I bridge from Ethereum?".</li>
                <li><strong>The Bot Searches Its Library:</strong> Before answering, the bot searches a private, curated library of documents (websites, guides, etc.) for the most relevant information related to your question. For this query, it would find sections from PulseChain.com about the bridge.</li>
                <li><strong>The Bot Reads and Synthesizes:</strong> It reads the relevant snippets it found.</li>
                <li><strong>The Bot Generates an Answer:</strong> Using a powerful AI model (GPT-4o-mini), it formulates an answer based *only* on the information it just read from its library. It then provides the source link for you to verify.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>This process prevents the bot from making things up or using outdated information from the general internet. It is restricted to its approved knowledge base.</p>

            <h2>The "Brain": Its Core AI Prompt</h2>
            <p>This is the master instruction set given to the AI. It tells the bot how to behave, what its goals are, and what rules to follow. Here is the exact prompt used:</p>
